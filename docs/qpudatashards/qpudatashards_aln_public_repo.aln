readme,summary,"ALN is an Auditable Legal Notation and infra/BCI/smart-city DSL for describing deterministic systems as CSV-like tables that compile into concrete engine inputs rather than remaining conceptual.",alpha
readme,status,"Project status: experimental/alpha; APIs, rowtypes, and CLI flags may change until 0.1.0; contributors should pin to tagged releases for production use.",alpha

design,goal-determinism,"Primary goal: deterministic infrastructure, QPU.Datashard, and augmented-human safety descriptions that render to reproducible CSV and artifacts without hidden side-effects.",locked
design,goal-auditable,"Goal: every ALN file must be human-auditable and machine-checked, with clear mapping from rowtypes to runtime effects and safety envelopes.",locked
design,goal-public,"Goal: keep the public ALN spec free of internal, classified, or enterprise-only semantics so that open-source users can rely on a stable, public contract.",locked
design,nongoal-hw-secrets,"Non-goal: ALN will not encode hardware keys, TPM secrets, or proprietary authentication material; such data must live in separate, private mechanisms.",locked
design,nongoal-runtime,"Non-goal: ALN is not a general-purpose Turing-complete runtime; it is a declarative description language that compiles to existing engines.",locked
design,compat-mermaid,"Compatibility: ALN schemas should be straightforward to visualize via mermaid and embed within Markdown documentation.",locked
